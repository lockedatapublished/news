We sponsored our first event yesterday!

[SQL Saturday Cambridge](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/632/eventhome.aspx) has been going for a while and not only holds sessions for SQL people but also for SharePoint people. [Mark Broadbent](//twitter.com/retracement) & co did a great job in the run up and during the event.

Steph presented an overview of data science and then got to spend the day hanging out and meeting awesome people. There were a lot of people looking to understand how data science could fit into their organisation and how they can acquire skills to help deliver data science projects. Check out the [Data Science Fundamentals slides](//itsalocke.com/talks/post/data-science-fundamentals/) to get a feel for what goes into a data science project.


At the end of the day we raffled off a copy of [R for Data Science](http://geni.us/rfords). It went to one of the SharePoint folks so we're hoping we'll be seeing a convert soon.
